# track-ur-weight

A web app to track a user's weight using python and django. 

The user will enter their weight and it will automatically save and update the database. Along with updating the database, the weight entered will also be added to the table on the landing page as well as the chart which show's a graph of their weight trend.


This is meant to be a project for me to learn how to use Django REST APIs and ChartJS.
Currently the app works and the table updates with new entries but the chart isn't updating at the same time.

When I redo this project, I think I will use React for the client side as opposed to django running both front and back-ends.

* CD into the directory and migrate using python manage.py migrate.
