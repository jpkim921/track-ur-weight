# track-your-weight

A single page web app that uses Django/Django REST Framework and React along with Chart.js. It's a simple app where a user can enter his/her weight and the chart and table will update automatically with the data from the API server.

I started on this project as a means to learn Python and the Django framework. It was also great learning the Chart.js library which helps with visualizing different kinds of charts and graphs.

## Getting Started

- Run and build main.js for React using command: npm run dev.
- Start API server with command: python manage.py runserver.
